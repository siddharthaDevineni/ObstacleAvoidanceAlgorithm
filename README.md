# Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm
Welcome to the Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm. 
It is about Path planning for a mobile Robot to reach its destination by avoiding obstacles safely resulting in an optimal path. The robot has to determine its location corresponding to its obstacles at each step and find a suitable strategy to achieve its target. A plethora of algorithms have been developed in order to planify a collision-free path for mobile robot encumbered environment and these algoritms fall into two categories: Local path planning and Global path planning depending on the information availability of environment. 

In the global path planning, information about the environment is already known in advance using grid, cells, map etc. Whereas in the local path planning, it is unknown and the robot has to discover its environment by sensors and then plans the path. This kind of path planning approaches are seen as real time obstacle avoidance. There is a lot of usage of it in the real world. For example, for an autonomous ship in avoiding collision with obstacles and to take the best possible route economically. It is possible to detect the distance between the robot with the target and the obstacles with the help of sensor. However, the sensor discussion is not conidered in this project.
