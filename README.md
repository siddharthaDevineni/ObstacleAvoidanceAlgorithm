# ObstacleAvoidanceAlgorithm
Welcome to the Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm. 
It is about Path planning for a mobile Robot to reach its destination by avoiding obstacles safely resulting in an optimal path. The robot has to determine its location corresponding to its obstacles at each step and find a suitable strategy to achieve its target. A plethora of algorithms have been developed in order to planify a collision-free path for mobile robot encumbered environment and these algoritms fall into two categories: Local path planning and Global path planning.
